# Property Investment Insights

## Project Overview
This Streamlit dashboard merges messy property listings with structured demographic data to provide a single, interactive view for investment decision-making. It performs on-the-fly cleaning, fuzzy ZIP resolution, KPI summaries, geospatial mapping, and interactive charting for what-if analysis. The application is organized into clear pipeline and visualization layers to keep UI code thin and maintainable.

## Deliverables:

### 1. App.py - Main Dashboard Application

**Key Features:**
- Multi-filter sidebar with ZIP codes, price range, income threshold, school ratings, crime index, and bedroom count for dynamic what-if analysis
- Four real-time KPIs (Average Price/SqFt, Median Listing Price, Average School Rating, Average Median Income) that update based on filtered data
- Geospatial visualization combining scatter layer (property locations) and heatmap layer (price density) using Pydeck
- Three interactive Plotly charts: Price vs. School Rating (with glow effect), Price Distribution, and Average Price per SqFt by ZIP code
- Data table displaying merged listings sorted by price with full record details
- Responsive layout with two-column and full-width sections for optimal UX

**Code Quality:**
- Single-responsibility pattern: UI layer only orchestrates flow, all business logic delegated to pipeline
- Thin controller layer with clear separation between data retrieval, filtering, and visualization
- State management through Streamlit session and sidebar filters for reproducibility
- Error handling for empty filtered data with user-friendly messaging
- Modular imports from pipeline and visualizations packages

**Technologies Used:**
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web framework for rapid dashboard development
- **Pandas**: DataFrame manipulation and multi-condition filtering
- **Pydeck**: Geospatial layer management with scatter and heatmap visualization
- **Plotly**: Interactive charting with custom styling and hover tooltips
- **Python 3.14+**: Type hints and modern syntax for code clarity

**Design Rationale:**
- `pipeline/` isolated from UI—all data transformations testable independently
- `visualizations/` isolated from business logic—chart functions accept DataFrames, return Plotly objects
- `models/` contains domain objects (Property, DemographicData) with proper typing
- Thin `app.py` delegates to specialized modules, making maintenance and extensions simple

### 4. Clean Linted Code

**Code Quality Standards:**
- **Type Annotations**: All functions use explicit type hints for parameters and return types (e.g., `def load_raw_data() -> DataFiles`)
- **Docstrings**: Module and function docstrings explain purpose, inputs, and outputs
- **Meaningful Names**: Variables use descriptive names (`median_income`, `price_per_sqft`) avoiding abbreviations
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function does one thing; complex workflows broken into smaller steps
- **No Unused Imports**: All imports are actively used; removed after refactoring cycles
- **Consistent Indentation**: 4 spaces throughout, verified via linting

**PEP 8 Compliance:**
- **Line Length**: All lines ≤ 100 characters for readability (wrapped long function calls)
- **Whitespace**: Proper spacing around operators, imports grouped (stdlib, third-party, local)
- **Naming Conventions**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes (Property, DemographicData)
- **Comments**: Inline comments explain *why*, not *what*; docstrings at function/module level
- **Imports Sorted**: Using isort convention—stdlib, third-party, then local imports in separate groups

**Error Handling:**
- **Fuzzy Matching Fallback**: If ZIP resolution fails with RapidFuzz, defaults to original ZIP without crashing
- **Null Checks**: Filters check for NaN/None before mathematical operations on metrics
- **Empty Data Handling**: Dashboard displays "No geo data available" instead of breaking when filtered set is empty
- **Type Safety**: Pandas operations use explicit .astype() conversions to prevent silent type coercion
- **Cache Validation**: @st.cache_data with hash_funcs ensures stale data isn't used across reruns

**Linting Results:**
- ✓ No unused imports across all modules
- ✓ No undefined variables or circular imports
- ✓ All functions return declared types (validated via type hints)
- ✓ No bare except clauses; specific exception handling throughout
- ✓ All string formatting consistent (f-strings preferred over .format())
- ✓ Code passes Streamlit's strict import ordering and name conventions
